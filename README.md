Module 5

## Overview
Analysis and visualization of ride-sharing and weekly fares data collected 1/1/2019 through 4/29/2019 in urban, suburban, and rural cities for use by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

#### Data Summary

The rides/fares data summary shows...
- Total Rides:  Urban cities outpace the other categories significantly in total number of rides, with more than two (2) times the number of rides in Suburban cities and more than ten (10) times the number of rides in Rural cities.
- Total Drivers:  As with Total Rides, there were significantly more drivers available in Urban cities relative to those available in Suburban and Rural cities.
- Total Fares:  Sixty-three (63) percent of total fares were collected in Urban cities, with Suburban cities accounting for thirty (30) percent and Rural cities accounting for only seven (7) percent of total fares.
- Average Fare per Ride:  Average Fare per Ride was highest in Rural cities, exceeding the average fare for Urban cities by approximately ten (10) dollars per ride.
- Average Fare per Driver:  Average Fare per Driver was also highest in Rural cities, exceeding average fare per driver in Suburban cities by more than fifteen (15) dollars per ride and average fare per driver in Urban cities by almost thirty-nine (39) dollars per ride. 

#### Total Fare by City Type

The Total Fare by City Type plot shows...
-  As also indicated by the summary data review, total fares from Urban cities were significantly higher than Suburban and Rural cities.
-  Total fares in Urban cities experienced more marked increases and decreases, particularly in the month of March, than Suburban and Rural cities.
-  All three city types experienced an increase in total fares the third week in February.
-  Total fares for Suburban and Rural cities were higher overall at the end of the measurement period than at the beginning of the measurement period.
-  Comparing the beginning of the measurement period to the end of the measurement period, total fares for Rural cities were flat.

## Summary
Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are made...
-  Perform a review of the Rural city market to determine if there is an unmet demand for rides.  Once this is determined, options to meet this demand could be explored, such as recruiting additional drivers.  If there is no current unmet demand, explore options to increase demand, such as special pricing for longer rides likely to occur in Rural city markets.
-  The Suburban city market was unremarkable relative to the Urban and Rural city markets.  Additional marketing and promotion in Suburban cities could drive an increase in rides and fares as consumers become aware of the benefits PyBer offers.
-  Identify factors contributing to relatively sporadic usage in Urban cities, particularly in March.  Develop strategies to reduce drops in rides/fares and drive increases overall.
